In this repositery i have made the landing page of Cursor, had tried to make it as similar as possible. Tried to  clone it nearly to real page.
I have maded this page on the big screen, so its layout are set according to that, and as its not responsive so you might face problem in layout if you are opeing on the laptop screen. I hope you will understand this.

I have divided the website in the three parts 
1.) Header.
2.) Main.
3.)Footer.

In header i have made the nav bar , and also putted postion of header to stick, so that i wont move as i scroll down. HAve putted many div inside the nav and used anchor tag inside it.
Have given the background colour to the body as #14120b, and used the font color of mostly, white color.


Then comes the main part, i have putted the most important portion of this website inside this, Used section tag given id's or classes to them. and have inserted multiple div's inside those sections. Used flex to arrange them at a required position.

Then comes the footer section,have also used the section tag here and inside it putted the div's and then again used the flex to align them. here majorly i have putted the companies information. license, copyright, security related concerns and things like this.

Conclusion:
This repo has complete information about this page, all the ss i have used are also here inside the src folder, you can look into it...
This assignment was a real grind for me, have taught me alot, a complete book of HTML and CSS, Learned alot, faced so many challanges, fought for single pixels, to make it work, tried many things, done so many experiments, and have always with some kind of learning with me...
