In this repositery i have Maded the landing page of mentlify. I have maded the file assignment on a big screen and this assignment is not design responsive, so please ignore layout if you are working on the laptop.I hope you understand.

I have tried to make it as similar as possible to the real website,this website in not responsive as their was no need to use the javascript.Have attached the image of every single photo of the website of each element. like header, footer and main.

In header tag i have uploaded the nav bar and 3-4 div tags inside it, with each having the different class.
I have used the font color here as white, then have changed the color to black, as per the requirement of the website.
Have used the flexbox here, to align it at the center. and also added the required gap in between. have used the flex direction coloumn here.

Then comes the main section or we can also call it as the hero section. 
Its contains many section tag with classes, id's and multiple divs. and have used the many flex inside it to get it as per the required position. Also added the hero image in this section, ending with the logos of companies. 

Then comes the footer, it also contains multiple sections some images, all the required images have been added to the src foolder you access the images through it.

ended the footer section with background of rgb(247,247,247). 

Conclusion:
This website has bring so much challanges to me and they were quite different then the cursors landing page, it took me alot efforts to set the background white after the image, have done it making the height of background image to 80vh and setting it to no repeat.
Have faced challamge in setting the right background of nav bar in trying to blur it. Their was a good fight in setting every single pixel to a right place. with correcting the pixels of images rightly. 

It was a great learing every the fighting with every single pixel,with images width, changing the padding margin so make it look perfect. have enjoyed this journey so much, loved it would love to have more challanges like this.
